/**
 * This is a container serialization object that serves as the root of a XML document.
 * BField stores all metadata and reference to rules and factories choosen when
 * creating a new battle. BField also serves as a bridge between raw data 
 * (bfield.data) and rules that manage them (bfield.rules).
 * Factories, being stored globally by the app, are serialized through the special
 * {@link bfield.data.adapters.XMLFactoryReferenceAdapter} class, so new bfield
 * documents always refer to application rules.
 * Rules and similar instances are serialized by saving the rule class simple name.
