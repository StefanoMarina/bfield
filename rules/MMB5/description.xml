5th edition rules as described by MarsupialMancer (https://marsupialmancer.blogspot.com/2019/08/birthright-5e-revised.html).
Units:
Shield icon: unit BCR
Sword icon: unit's individual modifier to 1d6 roll.
Army:
Shield icon: cumulative BCR
Sword icon: global 1d6 modifier that will be applied to each unit's roll, added to the unit's individual roll.
Note:
Only the "ignore terrain" modifier works, enable it to set unit's bonus on terrain (ie elves on forest).
Fortification army modifier is enabled, weather is not, no high ground rules.
The "Unit was wounded before battle" malus is not applied, sorry. Everything else should be there.
"Reserve" mode for units is appliable, effectiveness rule is not.
